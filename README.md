# GSU Data Challenge

In the scope of the Data Challenge, our aim is to predict future product sales quantities using the TAV dataset available to us.

Within this scope, the dataset has been examined. 
Discussions have been held on what kind of preprocessing needs to be done on the dataset. 
Research has been conducted on which models can be used for prediction. 
Roles have been assigned within the team. 
Regular meetings and communication have been conducted via Discord. 
After cleaning the dataset, it has been reexamined by visualizing the data. Prediction models have been applied to the dataset.
